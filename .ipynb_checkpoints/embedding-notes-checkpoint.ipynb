    "The embedding layer is used to transform our sparse one-hot vector (sparse as most of the elements are 0) into a dense embedding vector (dense as the dimensionality is a lot smaller and all the elements are real numbers). This embedding layer is simply a single fully connected layer. As well as reducing the dimensionality of the input to the RNN, there is the theory that words which have similar impact on the sentiment of the review are mapped close together in this dense vector space. For more information about word embeddings, see [here](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/word-embeddings-transform-text-numbers/).\n",

The act of converting a list of tokens into a list of indexes is commonly called *numericalizing*.\n",

    "\n",
    "The RNN returns 2 tensors, `output` of size _**[sentence length, batch size, hidden dim]**_ and `hidden` of size _**[1, batch size, hidden dim]**_. `output` is the concatenation of the hidden state from every time step, whereas `hidden` is simply the final hidden state. We verify this using the `assert` statement. Note the `squeeze` method, which is used to remove a dimension of size 1. \n",
